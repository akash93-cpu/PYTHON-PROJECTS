[1] PYTHON QUIZ PROGRAM
--------------------
Summary:
*JSON and SQL integration*

I created a versatile Python Quiz program which uses relational SQL databases to store user information and is also able to read data from JSON file types. The program is able to perform full CRUD functions used in SQL. It also features UI/UX design principles using the Tkinter library and keeps a basic record of all user log information in a terminal window.

[2] CALCULATOR 
-------------------

A simple scientific calculator that performs mathematical functions. It also features a history window.
